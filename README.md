# neomd

A minimal terminal email client for people who write in Markdown and live in Neovim.

[Neomd](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/neomd/) this is my way of implementing a email TUI based on my experience on [Neomutt](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/neomutt) focus on [Neovim](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/neovim) (input) and reading/writing ([Markdown](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/markdown)) and navigating, [Vim Motions](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/vim-language-and-motions).

![neomd](images/neomd.png)

Compose emails in your editor, read them rendered with [glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour), and manage your inbox with a [HEY-style screener](https://www.hey.com/features/the-screener/) — all from the terminal. 

## Features

- **Write in Markdown, send beautifully** — compose in `$EDITOR` (defaults to `nvim`), send as `multipart/alternative`: raw Markdown as plain text + goldmark-rendered HTML so recipients get clickable links and formatting
- **Glamour reading** — incoming emails rendered as styled Markdown in the terminal
- **HEY-style screener** — unknown senders land in `ToScreen`; press `I/O/F/P` to approve, block, mark as Feed, or mark as PaperTrail; reuses your existing `screened_in.txt` lists from neomutt
- **Folder tabs** — Inbox, ToScreen, Feed, PaperTrail, Archive, Waiting, Someday, Scheduled, Sent, Trash, ScreenedOut
- **Multi-select** — `space` marks emails, then batch-delete, move, or screen them all at once
- **Kanagawa theme** — colors from the [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) palette
- **IMAP + SMTP** — direct connection via RFC 6851 MOVE, no local sync daemon required

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sspaeti/neomd
cd neomd
make install   # installs to ~/.local/bin/neomd
```

Or just build locally:

```sh
make build
./neomd
```

## Configuration

On first run, neomd creates `~/.config/neomd/config.toml` with placeholders:

```toml
[[accounts]]
name     = "Personal"
imap     = "imap.example.com:993"   # :993 = TLS, :143 = STARTTLS
smtp     = "smtp.example.com:587"
user     = "me@example.com"
password = "app-password"
from     = "Me <me@example.com>"

# Multiple accounts supported — add more [[accounts]] blocks
# Switch between them with `a` in the inbox

[screener]
# reuse your existing neomutt allowlist files
screened_in  = "~/.dotfiles/mutt/.lists/screened_in.txt"
screened_out = "~/.dotfiles/mutt/.lists/screened_out.txt"
feed         = "~/.dotfiles/mutt/.lists/feed.txt"
papertrail   = "~/.dotfiles/mutt/.lists/papertrail.txt"

[folders]
inbox        = "INBOX"
sent         = "Sent"
trash        = "Trash"
drafts       = "Drafts"
to_screen    = "ToScreen"
feed         = "Feed"
papertrail   = "PaperTrail"
screened_out = "ScreenedOut"
archive      = "Archive"
waiting      = "Waiting"
scheduled    = "Scheduled"
someday      = "Someday"

[ui]
theme       = "dark"   # dark | light | auto
inbox_count = 50
```

Use an app-specific password (Gmail, Fastmail, Hostpoint, etc.) rather than your main account password.

After saving and closing the editor, the email is sent automatically.

## How Sending Works

neomd sends every email as `multipart/alternative`:

- **`text/plain`** — the raw Markdown you wrote (readable as-is in any client)
- **`text/html`** — rendered by [goldmark](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark) with a clean CSS wrapper

This means recipients using Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook, etc. see properly formatted links, bold, headers, and code blocks — while you write nothing but Markdown.

## Inspirations

- [Neomutt](https://neomutt.org) — the gold standard terminal email client; neomd reuses its screener list format and borrows many keybindings
- [HEY](https://www.hey.com/features/the-screener/) — the Screener concept: unknown senders wait for a decision before reaching your inbox
- [hey-cli](https://github.com/sspaeti/hey-cli) — a Go CLI for HEY; provided the bubbletea patterns used here
- [newsboat](https://newsboat.org) — RSS reader whose `O` open-in-browser binding and vim navigation feel inspired neomd's reader view
- [emailmd.dev](https://www.emailmd.dev) — the idea that email should be written in Markdown
- [charmbracelet/pop](https://github.com/charmbracelet/pop) — minimal Go email sender from Charm
- [charmbracelet/glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour) — Markdown rendering in the terminal
- [kanagawa.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) — the color palette used for the inbox
- [msgvault](https://github.com/sspaeti/msgvault) — Go IMAP archiver; the IMAP client code in neomd is adapted from it
